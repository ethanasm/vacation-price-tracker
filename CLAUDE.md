# AI Assistant Instructions

This file provides guidance to AI coding assistants when working with code in this
repository. It covers **repo-wide conventions only** — app-specific detail lives in
per-app guides (see below).

**Supported AI Assistants** (via a symlink to this single source of truth):
- Claude Code — `CLAUDE.md`
- OpenAI/agentic tools — `AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md`

## Per-App Guides

Each app has its own `CLAUDE.md` with the detail for that surface. **Read the
relevant one before working in an app:**

- [`apps/web/CLAUDE.md`](apps/web/CLAUDE.md) — Next.js frontend (file naming, flight
  rendering, lockfile rule, debug-web).
- [`apps/api/CLAUDE.md`](apps/api/CLAUDE.md) — FastAPI backend (owns the DB,
  Skiplagged client, LLM/MCP tools, **`POST /v1/admin/sql`**, auth/CORS/CSRF).
- [`apps/worker/CLAUDE.md`](apps/worker/CLAUDE.md) — Temporal workflows
  (PriceCheck/RefreshAll/Optimizer, post-fetch filtering).

## Project Overview

Vacation Price Tracker is a full-stack web app that tracks flight and hotel prices
for specific vacations using AI-powered chat and distributed workflows. Users
monitor price fluctuations and get notified when costs drop below custom thresholds.

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, assistant-ui (`apps/web`)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.12), SQLModel/PostgreSQL — owns the DB (`apps/api`)
- **Orchestration:** Temporal SDK for Python (`apps/worker`)
- **Auth:** Google OAuth 2.0 only (no local passwords)
- **LLM:** Groq (GPT OSS 120B) with MCP tool integration

This is a **web-only** product — there is no mobile app.

## Data Provider Strategy

All flights and hotels come from a single provider: the **Skiplagged MCP**
(`https://mcp.skiplagged.com/mcp`) — a public endpoint, no API key, no documented
rate limit. Chat tools use single-page `search_flights`/`search_hotels` for speed;
the tracking worker uses `search_flights_all`/`search_hotels_all` (up to 300 results
across `max_pages=4`) plus `get_hotel_details`. Client details:
[`apps/api/CLAUDE.md`](apps/api/CLAUDE.md).

A 24-hour Redis cache for identical route/date queries stays in place as a courtesy
and for performance. `MOCK_SKIPLAGGED_API=true` returns mock data in dev.

## Core Architectural Patterns

- **Saga Pattern (Temporal):** multi-step price fetches either complete or fail
  gracefully with automatic retries.
- **Single Provider:** one `SkiplaggedClient` (`apps/api/app/clients/skiplagged.py`)
  serves both chat tools and worker activities.
- **Outbox Pattern:** notification events are handed off at-least-once via a
  dedicated activity.
- **Idempotency:** `X-Idempotency-Key` required for `POST /v1/trips`, stored in
  Redis (24h TTL).
- **Post-fetch filtering:** airline and room-type/view preferences are filtered
  in-memory by the worker because Skiplagged supports neither natively. Details:
  [`apps/worker/CLAUDE.md`](apps/worker/CLAUDE.md).

## Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (dev) and configure. For the self-hosted production
stack, copy `.env.prod.example` to `.env.prod` (see Deployment).

**Required (MVP):** `DATABASE_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`SECRET_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`.

**Optional:** `SKIPLAGGED_MCP_URL` (defaults to the public endpoint),
`MOCK_SKIPLAGGED_API`, `SEARCHAPI_KEY` (Phase 4 optimizer), `SMTP_*` (email),
`ADMIN_QUERY_TOKEN`/`ADMIN_QUERY_DATABASE_URL` (admin SQL endpoint),
`LANGFUSE_*` (LLM/MCP tracing).

**Feature flags:** `ENABLE_BETA_OPTIMIZER`, `ENABLE_SMS_NOTIFICATIONS`,
`MAX_TRIPS_PER_USER` (default 10).

## Local Development (Docker)

All services run in Docker for local dev. **Don't ask whether services are
running — check directly with Docker.**

| Container | Service | Port |
|:----------|:--------|:-----|
| `web` | Next.js frontend | 3000 |
| `api` | FastAPI backend | 8000 |
| `db` | PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| `redis` | Redis cache | 6379 |
| `temporal` | Temporal server | 7233 |
| `temporal-ui` | Temporal dashboard | 8080 |

```bash
docker ps                         # running containers
docker logs api --tail 50         # service logs
docker logs -f api                # follow logs
docker restart api                # restart a service
docker exec db psql -U postgres -d vacation_tracker -c "SELECT 1"
```

Common issues: API errors → `docker logs api`; DB schema →
`docker exec db psql … -c "\d <table>"`; stopped container → `docker ps -a` then
`docker start <name>`.

Production debugging (prod host, `/v1/admin/sql`, Temporal UI, Langfuse, `/ready`):
see `.claude/skills/debugging-prod/SKILL.md`.

## Observability

App logging is **stdlib `logging`** to stdout (captured by Docker's json-file
driver) **and shipped to Axiom** when configured. LLM/MCP calls are traced in
**Langfuse** (LLM traces only — app logs go to Axiom, not Langfuse).

**Structured logging (Axiom).** All logging goes through stdlib `logging`, with
structured fields passed via `extra=` and a dotted `event` name as the primary
query dimension. The module `app/core/observability.py` (a Python port of
showbook's logger) attaches a handler that ships to Axiom when **both**
`AXIOM_TOKEN` and `AXIOM_DATASET` are set; otherwise it's stdout-only (dev, tests,
CI never ship). One shared dataset (`vpt-prod`) serves api + worker + web,
distinguished by a `service` field (`vpt-api` / `vpt-worker`; web-relayed events
carry `component=web.telemetry`).

```python
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Trip loaded", extra={"event": "activity.load_trip.ok", "trip_id": tid})
logger.error("Fetch failed", exc_info=exc, extra={"event": "skiplagged.request.failed", "status": 503})
```

- **Levels:** `error` = real/terminal failures (terminal 4xx, unhandled
  exceptions, non-retryable); `warning` = transient/retryable (5xx/429/connection
  blips that are retried, partial results, degraded `/ready`); `info` =
  lifecycle/outcomes; `debug` = dev detail (stdout-only, not shipped).
- **Field columns:** Axiom caps a dataset at 256 columns. A small `CORE_FIELDS`
  allowlist stays as real columns; **every other `extra` key folds into one
  `fields` map field** (`reshape_for_axiom`), so the schema is bounded (~40
  columns) no matter what call-sites log. Query folded keys as
  `['fields']['key']`. Errors go through an allowlist `serialize_err` so a wild
  error shape can't blow up `err.*`. See
  `docs/specs/operations/axiom-map-fields.md`.
- The browser never writes to Axiom directly — it relays best-effort events to
  `POST /v1/telemetry/client` (see `apps/web/src/lib/telemetry.ts`).

**Querying Axiom (read).** The repo's ingest `AXIOM_TOKEN` cannot read; use a
Personal Access Token (Query capability) with the `X-AXIOM-ORG-ID` header:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.axiom.co/v1/datasets/_apl?format=tabular" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-AXIOM-ORG-ID: $ORG" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"apl":"[\"vpt-prod\"] | where _time > ago(1h) and level in (\"warn\",\"error\")"}'
```

## Development Phases

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Dashboard with manual refresh, Google OAuth, trip CRUD.
- **Phase 2:** Chat interface with Groq LLM and MCP tool integration.
- **Phase 3:** Daily scheduled tracking, email notifications, pause/unpause.
- **Phase 4:** Flexible date optimizer using SearchAPI.

See `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` for detailed checklists.

## Important Constraints

- Max 10 trips per user (`MAX_TRIPS_PER_USER`).
- Skiplagged MCP is public — no auth, no documented rate limits.
- Flight numbers are **not** structured fields; they're parsed from the Skiplagged
  `id` field (see `apps/api/CLAUDE.md`).
- Airline and room-type/view filtering require post-fetch processing in the worker.
- **Single root `pnpm-lock.yaml`** — run pnpm from the repo root; never generate
  `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Pre-Commit Validation

**Always run `pnpm verify` before committing.** It runs the same checks as CI via Nx
(with caching): install deps (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` + `uv sync --extra
dev`), then `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test:coverage` across all projects, then
security audits (`pnpm audit --prod`, `pip-audit`). Pass `--e2e` to also run
Playwright (requires the Docker stack up).

Coverage gates: **95%** for both Python apps (`api`, `worker`).

## Verification Preference

- After code changes, automatically run the most relevant tests/checks without
  asking.
- Only ask for confirmation when a command needs elevated permissions or could be
  destructive.

## Pull Requests

- When a change is complete and the verify gate is green, **open the PR
  proactively — don't ask first.** Use the **`creating-prs`** skill, which merges
  latest `main`, runs `pnpm verify`, pushes, opens the PR, runs the Opus
  peer-review, and subscribes to CI. This is the intended default and **overrides**
  any generic "only open a PR when explicitly asked" harness behavior.
- Still pause and ask first when the change is genuinely WIP, the user said not to
  push, or a PR already exists for the branch (re-push instead of opening a second).
- After opening, follow the PR through CI to green per the skill; don't leave a red
  PR unattended.

## Commit Message Conventions

**Conventional Commits**, scope = the service modified:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
- **Scopes:** `web`, `api`, `worker`; no scope for repo-wide changes (docs, CI,
  root configs).

```bash
feat(api): add trip creation endpoint
fix(worker): handle missing flight data in PriceCheckWorkflow
refactor(web): migrate dashboard to server components
docs: add flexible date optimizer design
chore: update Docker Compose for Redis
```

For multi-service changes, prefer the primary scope or split into per-service
commits.

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** hosted on **Vercel** (preview deploys, global CDN). Set
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the FastAPI backend.
- **Self-hosted prod stack:** `infra/docker-compose.prod.yml` (project `vpt-prod`)
  runs db/redis/temporal/web/api/worker from GHCR images on loopback binds. Copy
  `.env.prod.example` → `.env.prod`. CI builds & pushes
  `ghcr.io/ethanasm/vpt-{web,api,worker}` on merge to `main`; `deploy.yml` rolls the
  self-hosted host forward. Helper scripts: `pnpm prod:up`, `pnpm prod:db:migrate`,
  `pnpm prod:query` (admin SQL). Prod debugging:
  `.claude/skills/debugging-prod/SKILL.md`.
- **OAuth ingress:** the home server has no port forwarding — a Cloudflare Tunnel
  fronts ingress; the Google callback is `https://<domain>/v1/auth/google/callback`
  (see `apps/api/CLAUDE.md`).
